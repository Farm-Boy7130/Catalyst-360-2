Hi! If you're reading this then chances are you're probably a nerd, interested in calculating the dispalcement of engines quickly and easily. Or maybe just somebody who's really bored.
Either which way, my program is easy to use, user friendly, functional, and most important, Open-Sourced. It's written 100% in C++.
There are other things you can use this program for, such as calculating compression ratios of engines (WIP).
I hope my program brings you a lot of help and lessens your frustration whenever you can't remember how to do math. Thanks for using my program!
